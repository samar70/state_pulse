# StatePulse

A lightweight, fast, dependency-free state-management library inspired by Provider and Hydrated Bloc — but 10× simpler.

## 🚀 Features

- Minimal API (only 3 classes)
- No boilerplate
- Automatic persistence (HydratedStatePulse)
- Uses Flutter’s built-in InheritedNotifier + AnimatedBuilder
- Zero dependencies (shared_preferences only for persistence)
- Designed for small, medium & large apps
